Brainstroke is a medical emergency which occurs when the blood flow to the brain is halted or reduced depriving the brain tissues the appropriate amount of oxygen. This condition is fatal to human health and a person could die soon. Early detection of a brainstroke can help to prevent or lessen the severity of the stroke, which can lower death rates. Therefore, the aim of this project is to look into the classification of stroke potential and come up with a simple and reliable model to predict. In this project, Machine Learning algorithms such as Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithm is applied to build a model which predicts if a person could have a brainstroke or not based on certain parameters.
